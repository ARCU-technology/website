      <description>Imagine wandering through the vast digital collections of the Badisches Landesmuseum Karlsruhe and the Allard Pierson Amsterdam, each holding a treasure of objects waiting to be explored. The Collection Space Navigator (CSN) serves as a virtual guide and offers a new way to engage with these collections. As part of the Creative User Empowerment project, the Datalab CSN becomes a bridge between the curator&amp;rsquo;s expertise and the rich visual data available to them.</description>

      <description>The Estonian Newsreels were a series of short news documentaries that captured the life and events of Estonia from 1923 to 1997. They are a valuable source of historical and cultural information, but they are also difficult to access and explore due to their large volume and inherent complexities of the medium. With the Kinokroonika CSN, we address this challenge and provide an interactive visualization interface that allows users to navigate the film footage of the Estonian Newsreels in an explorative way.</description>
